# CyberGrid Conway CA Glider Test Integration Guide

## Understanding the Dual-CA Architecture

Based on your analysis, the Swarm-100 codebase has **two separate CA systems**:

### 1. CyberGrid (C++)
- **Implementation:** Conway's Game of Life on 100√ó100 toroidal grid
- **Properties:** Each cell has `alive` (Life state) and `energy` (LoRA pulse intensity)
- **Purpose:** Spatial substrate for stigmergic coordination
- **Location:** Likely in `cybergrid.cpp` or similar C++ module

### 2. Rule Engine (Python)
- **Implementation:** Diffusion-damping CA on 512-dimensional state vectors
- **Properties:** Each bot's state vector averaged with neighbors plus noise
- **Purpose:** Agent behavioral dynamics
- **Location:** Python rule engine, updates `swarm_state.yaml`

---

## Why Ticks Weren't Progressing

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Global Tick Coordinator Failure**
   - Emits ticks but fails to notify bots
   - Async communication issue between coordinator and agents

2. **YAML Corruption**
   - Multiple processes writing concurrently to `swarm_state.yaml`
   - Parsing failure at line 52009
   - File locking mechanism needed

3. **Rule Engine vs CyberGrid Disconnect**
   - Rule Engine successfully updates tick counter
   - CyberGrid Conway CA may not be advancing
   - Need separate verification for each CA system

## Glider Test Methodology

### Why Test Gliders?

Gliders are the **canonical test pattern** for Conway's Game of Life because:

1. **Deterministic behavior:** Period-4 oscillation, moves 1 cell diagonally per period
2. **Sensitive to rule errors:** Any deviation in B3/S23 rules breaks glider motion
3. **Tests toroidal boundaries:** Glider wraps around grid edges
4. **Simple to verify:** 5 cells, predictable trajectory

### Test Implementation

The `test_cybergrid_glider.py` script provides:

```python
# 1. Standard glider pattern
GLIDER = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
# Period 4, velocity (1, 1) per period

# 2. Verification tests
- test_glider_period()      # Confirms pattern repeats after 4 steps
- test_still_life()          # Confirms block pattern stays stable
- test_glider_period()       # Tests oscillators (blinker, toad)
```

### Expected Results

**If CyberGrid Conway CA is working correctly:**
- ‚úÖ Glider completes period-4 cycle
- ‚úÖ Cell count preserved (5 cells)
- ‚úÖ Pattern moves diagonally
- ‚úÖ Still lifes remain stable
- ‚úÖ Oscillators return to initial state after period

**If failing:**
- ‚ùå Glider explodes or dies
- ‚ùå Cell count changes
- ‚ùå Pattern doesn't move or moves incorrectly
- ‚ùå Still lifes change
- ‚ùå Indicates B3/S23 rule implementation error

## Integration with Swarm-100 Validation Protocol

### Add to Baseline Phase (After T2.3)

```yaml
- test_id: T2.4
  name: "Conway CA Glider Verification"
  description: "Test CyberGrid Conway CA with standard glider pattern"
  execution:
    mode: headless
    duration_seconds: 30
    ca_enabled: true
    agents_enabled: false
    test_script: "test_cybergrid_glider.py"
  metrics:
    - name: "glider_period_correct"
      expected_value: true
      critical: true
    - name: "cell_count_preserved"
      expected_value: true
      critical: true
    - name: "still_life_stable"
      expected_value: true
      critical: true
  gate:
    pass_criteria:
      - glider_period_correct == true
      - cell_count_preserved == true
      - still_life_stable == true
    failure_action: "HALT_PHASE"
    notes: "Validates core Conway CA implementation in CyberGrid"
```

### Why This Matters

**CyberGrid Conway CA is foundational** for:
- Stigmergic energy field coordination
- LoRA energy coupling (energy property per cell)
- Spatial pattern formation
- Multi-agent coordination substrate

**If glider test fails:**
- Cannot trust CA substrate behavior
- Stigmergic coordination may be broken
- Energy field dynamics unreliable
- Must fix before proceeding to agent tests

## Recommended Testing Sequence

### Step 1: Isolate CyberGrid CA
```bash
# Test Conway CA in isolation (no agents, no rule engine)
python test_cybergrid_glider.py
```

### Step 2: Verify Tick Progression
```python
# Add logging to CyberGrid step() function
def step(self):
    self.generation += 1
    print(f"CyberGrid tick: {self.generation}")
    # ... apply Conway rules
```

### Step 3: Fix YAML Corruption
```python
# Implement file locking for swarm_state.yaml
import fcntl

with open('swarm_state.yaml', 'r+') as f:
    fcntl.flock(f, fcntl.LOCK_EX)  # Exclusive lock
    # ... read/write YAML
    fcntl.flock(f, fcntl.LOCK_UN)  # Unlock
```

### Step 4: Separate CA Telemetry
Instead of shared `swarm_state.yaml`:
- CyberGrid ‚Üí `cybergrid_state.h5` (HDF5)
- Rule Engine ‚Üí `rule_engine_state.h5` (HDF5)
- Agents ‚Üí `agent_state.h5` (HDF5)

Benefits:
- No concurrent write conflicts
- Faster I/O (binary format)
- Easier analysis
- Aligns with validation protocol telemetry schema

### Step 5: Integrate with Validation Suite
```bash
# Add T2.4 to swarm100_validation_protocol.yaml
# Run full baseline phase
python autonomous_test_runner.py
```

## Debugging Checklist

### If Glider Test Fails:

**Check 1: Grid Initialization**
- [ ] Grid is 100√ó100
- [ ] Toroidal boundary conditions enabled
- [ ] Initial pattern placement correct

**Check 2: Conway Rules (B3/S23)**
- [ ] Birth: exactly 3 neighbors ‚Üí cell born
- [ ] Survival: 2 or 3 neighbors ‚Üí cell survives
- [ ] Death: < 2 or > 3 neighbors ‚Üí cell dies

**Check 3: Tick Progression**
- [ ] `step()` function called
- [ ] Generation counter increments
- [ ] Grid state actually updates

**Check 4: Toroidal Wrapping**
- [ ] Neighbors calculated with modulo
- [ ] Edge cells wrap to opposite edge
- [ ] Corner cells have correct 8 neighbors

**Check 5: Energy Field Interaction**
- [ ] LoRA energy field doesn't interfere with Conway rules
- [ ] `alive` and `energy` properties separate
- [ ] Energy updates don't affect Conway state transitions

## Next Steps After Glider Validation

### 1. Energy Field Coupling Test
Once Conway CA verified, test LoRA energy coupling:
```python
# Test that glider movement generates energy trace
# Verify energy field doesn't break glider motion
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Interaction Test
Add agents back in:
```python
# Agents move on CyberGrid
# Verify agents don't corrupt CA substrate
# Test stigmergic coordination via energy field
```

### 3. Full Integration Test
Run complete swarm with both CA systems:
```python
# CyberGrid Conway CA + Rule Engine diffusion CA
# Verify tick coordination
# Confirm no YAML corruption
```

## File Locations

**Test Script:**
- `test_cybergrid_glider.py` (created)

**Integration Points:**
- `swarm100_validation_protocol.yaml` (add T2.4)
- `autonomous_test_runner.py` (add glider test handler)

**Expected CyberGrid Files (in your repo):**
- `cybergrid.cpp` or `cybergrid.py` (CA implementation)
- `swarm_main.py` (main orchestrator)
- `tick_coordinator.py` (global tick emitter)

---

## Conclusion

The glider test is a **foundational validation** that must pass before trusting any higher-level swarm behavior. It verifies:

1. ‚úÖ Conway CA rules implemented correctly
2. ‚úÖ Toroidal grid working
3. ‚úÖ Tick progression functioning
4. ‚úÖ No state corruption

**Pass this test first**, then build confidence in:
- Stigmergic coordination
- Energy field dynamics
- Multi-agent interactions
- Dimensional scaling claims

This is the **rock-solid baseline** you need before advancing to fault tolerance and distributed testing.
