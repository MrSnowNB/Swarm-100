  overview: |
    The Swarm-100 system demonstrates a solid foundation for distributed AI agent deployment across 4x RTX 6000 Ada GPUs (192GB total VRAM).
    However, several architectural bottlenecks and optimization opportunities have been identified through analysis of best practices for 100+ agent systems.

  strengths:
    - "GPU-optimized distribution: 25 bots per GPU maximizes parallel processing capabilities"
    - "Local model deployment: Ollama air-gapped setup ensures security and reduces latency"
    - "Observability infrastructure: OpenTelemetry tracing provides excellent debugging capabilities"
    - "Resource efficiency: Q4 quantization and 4096 context length balance performance and memory usage"
    - "Modular design: Bot template system allows for consistent deployment patterns"
